In the quiet corners of forgotten lands,
Where time and neglect walk hand in hand,
There lies a beauty in decay's gentle touch,
A story told by rust, a language of the past.

The iron weeps its silent tears,
As nature's hand erodes its fears,
Each flake a memory of days gone by,
Whispering secrets to the endless sky.

Rust blooms like a crimson flower,
A reminder of man's fleeting power,
It paints a picture of inevitable change,
A dance of life and death, so strange.

So let us embrace the rusted hue,
And see the beauty in what once was new,
For in decay, there lies a kind of art,
A testament to the resilience of the human heart.
